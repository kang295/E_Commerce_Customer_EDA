# E_Commerce_Customer_EDA

Objective:
Segmenting customers into different groups using 2 years of customer data and set the appropriate marketing strategy. The goal is to find the primary group that brings the most profit to our business and find their characteristics and preferences. For this process, I would like to utilize RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis.

Recency: How current did the customer make a purcahse?
Frequency: How often did the customer make a purchase?
Monetary: How much did the customer spend on product?

Tools & Libraries:
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
